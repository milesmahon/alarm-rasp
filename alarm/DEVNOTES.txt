To add:
	Truncation of eg wind speed, temperature(78.33333 >> 78)

WEATHERGET:
	Works. 
	Just has humid, wind speed and temp, but it talks. 
	Would like to make things like city and a toggle for humidity, 
precipitation etc to be global (thru alarmConfig)

NEWS:
	Works, but voice is a little wonky
	Will be better if I wrote my own speech.sh, where it breaks at every
period -- this is way better for stuff like news headlines (rather than
just breaking at a space around 100 chars which is what Dan Fountain script
does). Put the speaking in a separate file so all speaking can be together eventually

SPEECH.SH:
	Would like to write my own
	Uses mpg123, explanation of flags for speed up/slow down in comments in script
	See "NEWS:" for changes needed
	Would "mpg123 10 -q [whatever] http://translate.google.com/'string'" work?
	
RADIO:
	Try mpg123 -q -h 10 -d 11 (or whatever) http://radio-web-player.whatever
	This probably won't work

META:
	All things work as of 7/21/15 -- news and weather and cron
	Add functionality to news and weather, as well as add other functions eg 
play music/radio, send text to phone or something, stocks?? BTC??
	A webpage hosting could be interesting... but would only be useful if something other than cron triggered the alarm, bc then could edit from webpage
	Nvm that would be a totally different version if on web
	Would still be interesting
	Sync with (eg Google) calendar for events, though I don't use this

CRON:
	crontab -e will let you edit cron file and schedule jobs
	using >>alarm.log will put everything printed onscreen into log file, otherwise nothing prints.
	
	
updates:
9/10 implemented the config file toggles for weatherGet for wind, humidity; still need to do precip
